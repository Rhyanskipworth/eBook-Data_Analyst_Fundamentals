# Everyone Has To Start Somewhere

Hello!

This "eBook" is meant to be a "Fundamentals Guide" for the students with no prior experience in data science. Many of the resources recommended are free/affordable (as I wanted when I started). Every chapter is succinct and should be treated as a mere guide meant to point you along the path best suited for your own research and projects.
