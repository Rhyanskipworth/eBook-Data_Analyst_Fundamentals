# eBook-My Journey into Data Science
eBook for students who want to learn fundamental data science skills.

Hello!

This "eBook" is meant to be a "Fundamentals Guide" for the college graduate with no prior experience in data science, but has the aptitude and curiosity for becoming a data professional (like I had). Many of the resources recommended are free/affordable. Every chapter is succinct and should be treated as a mere guide meant to point you along the path best suited for your own research and projects.
