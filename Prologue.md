# Intro: My Journey into Data Science

Hello! 

This "eBook" is meant to be a "Fundamentals Guide" for the college graduate with no prior experience in data science, but has the aptitude and curiosity for becoming a data professional (like I had). Every chapter is succinct and should be treated as a mere guide meant to point you along the path best suited for your own research and projects.

Best Tips I ever heard starting out,
  "DO NOT HAVE A 5-YR PLAN." Commit to a goal, but be open to new opportunities and make sure you enjoy the work/knowledge that comes with it.
  "USE YOUR DEGREE." Many of the resources recommended are free due to my personal philosophy on "Education vs Knowledge"
  
This is a game. Make sure you're always reaching that next level in the learning curve. Software is simply a tool to understand data.
